Opportunities by Persona

Instead of having a backlog of User Stories, I’ve seen teams having backlogs of opportunities categorized by persona. The opportunity backlogs feed into the roadmap and into the team’s User Story Backlog.

An opportunity is described by:
What problem are we trying to solve? Which need are we exploiting? (Why should we do this?)
For whom are we trying to solve this problem? (Persona)
Success criteria. How will we know that we have succeeded?
