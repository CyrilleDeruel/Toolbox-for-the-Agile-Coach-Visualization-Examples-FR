Confidence Smileys
This is a powerful alternative (or complement) to a Sprint Burndown.

At the end of every Daily Stand-up meeting the team asks themselves; how confident are we that we will be able to finish each User Story by the end of the Sprint. The answer is represented by a Confidence Smiley. 

The team quickly goes through each lane/User Story and updates the color of the Confidence Smiley. When in disagreement, the most pessimistic voice wins.
