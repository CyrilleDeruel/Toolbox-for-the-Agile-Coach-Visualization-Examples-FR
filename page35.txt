Daily Stand-up timer

One team I was working with repeatedly decided that they should really limit the Daily Stand-up meeting to 15 minutes, but never succeeded to accomplish it. One day I placed my tablet on a small table (that happened to be positioned in front of the wall) and started a timer. I didn’t explain why.

That simple thing made everyone slightly more focused and avoided a lot of detail derailing. And voilà! As if the tablet held a secret superpower, the Daily Stand-up meetings most of the times finished well below 15 minutes.

Note: The goal of the Daily Stand-up meeting is of course not to finish within 15 minutes, it is to figure out how we as a team need to collaborate today to accomplish our goals.
