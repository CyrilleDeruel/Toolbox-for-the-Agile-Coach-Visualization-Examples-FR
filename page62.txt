Stress Level Meter

Are there days when you as a team is swamped and stressed with work and just want to be left alone? While other days are calm, almost boring.

To share your stress level with others, making them aware of your mood, put up a Stress Level Meter next to the entrance to your team area. Perhaps you have a suitable door frame, a glass wall or something else colleagues need to pass by in order to enter the team area. 

At any given point, anyone in the team can move the arrow of the Stress Level Meter, reflecting the mood of the room advising people how to approach the team.
