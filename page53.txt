Reward Jar

Creating new habits can be difficult. To reward yourselves for your efforts of converting new policies to habits, get a Reward Jar. List the things you want to reward yourselves for (together as a team), including the score for each achievement. Agree on some milestones that are put on the jar.
â€¨Whenever you "score", place a marble in the jar. When you hit a milestone: collect the reward!
