Tips
Write on Post-its with a proper pen, thicker than a normal pencil (like Sharpies, Pilot SignPens or similar). Donâ€™t write small text, it needs to be readable from a couple of meters. Only using CAPS almost automatically makes the text bigger and more readable.

Buy proper Post-its. Avoid the cheap fake ones. Get a lot of different sizes and colors. I can recommend Super Sticky Post-its and Stattys.

To make it simpler to draw straight lines on a whiteboard, get a big ruler.
