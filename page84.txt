Pre-printed DONE checklists

A simple way of making it easy to remember the agreed upon Definition of DONE is to print cheat checklists. Put them in a box or hang them on a nail.

When you start working on a new User Story, grab one of the pre-printed Definition of DONE checklist. As your work progress, you tick the boxes.

Tip: Donâ€™t print too big batches. The Definition of DONE has a tendency to change a lot over time.
