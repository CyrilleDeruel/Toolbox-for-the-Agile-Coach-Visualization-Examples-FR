Achievement posters

At the end of every sprint (or every second week if you use Kanban) summarize your teamâ€™s achievements. To build pride and celebrate accomplishments is as important as planning ahead and focusing on the next challenge.

Set a timer on fifteen minutes during which you help out to remember and summarize. The prouder you are over an accomplishment, the bigger the Post-it. Use different colors for different kinds of events. Once the poster is hung on the wall, applaud yourselves.
