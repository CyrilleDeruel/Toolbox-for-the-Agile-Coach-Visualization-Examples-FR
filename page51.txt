Awesome Person Dice

Just for fun, choose today’s Awesome Person of the Day by rolling a dice at the beginning of the Daily Stand-up meeting.

Each side of the dice has a team member’s name written on it. Are you more than six people in the team, no worries – there are 8 and 10 sided dice as well.

Once a Today’s Awesome Person has been selected, applaud that person and put their photo in the Today’s Awesome Person photo frame that hangs on the wall.

Why? Because it’s fun.
